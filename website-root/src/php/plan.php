    <div>
      <p>We recommend booking in advance to ensure that you guarantee and schedule your spot and to make entry quick and simple.  Of course, you can also come right in without a pre-existing booking and we'll get you set up.</p>

          <p>Purchase activity online.  Get your purchase code and go to website to register account.  Add optional Top-Up funds to enable a cashless experience.  (Note: If not participating in an activity, please purchase the Spectator Pass for $10.  You can use this fee towards any purchases in the building).</p>
